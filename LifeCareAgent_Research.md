### Multi-Agent Architecture Patterns

**OpenAI Agents SDK** (Recommended approach):
```python
from agents import Agent, Runner

research_agent = Agent(
    name="MedicalResearcher",
    instructions="Research medical devices and medications for life care planning",
    tools=[web_search_tool, api_integration_tool, cost_analysis_tool]
)

cost_agent = Agent(
    name="CostAnalyst",
    instructions="Calculate present value and geographic adjustments",
    tools=[calculation_tool, inflation_tool, geographic_tool]
)

coordinator = Agent(
    name="LifeCareCoordinator",
    instructions="Orchestrate complete life care research workflow",
    handoffs=[research_agent, cost_agent]
)
```

**Cost Optimization Strategies:**
- Use GPT-4o Mini for routine tasks (75% cost reduction)

            CMSAPIConnector(),
            FDAOpenFDAConnector(),
            HospitalTransparencyConnector()
        ]
        self.paid_sources = [
            GoodRxAPIConnector(),
            CommercialDBConnector()
        ]
        self.cache = RedisCache()

    async def get_medication_pricing(self, ndc: str, location: str):
        # Try cache first
        cached_result = self.cache.get(f"med_price:{ndc}:{location}")
        if cached_result:
            return cached_result

        # Parallel API calls
        tasks = [
            self.goodrx_api.get_price(ndc, location),
            self.cms_api.get_asp_price(ndc),
            self.transparency_scraper.get_hospital_prices(ndc, location)
        ]

        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        aggregated_price = self.calculate_weighted_average(results)

        # Cache with TTL
        self.cache.set(f"med_price:{ndc}:{location}", aggregated_price, ttl=3600)
        return aggregated_price
```

### Cost Calculation Engine

**Present Value Analysis:**
```python
class PresentValueCalculator:
    def __init__(self, discount_rate=0.03, inflation_rate=0.025):
        self.discount_rate = discount_rate
        self.inflation_rate = inflation_rate

    def calculate_pva(self, annual_cost: float, years: int,
                      geographic_factor: float = 1.0) -> float:
        """Calculate present value with geographic adjustment"""
        adjusted_annual_cost = annual_cost * geographic_factor

        pv_total = 0
        for year in range(1, years + 1):
            inflated_cost = adjusted_annual_cost * ((1 + self.inflation_rate) ** year)
            discounted_cost = inflated_cost / ((1 + self.discount_rate) ** year)
            pv_total += discounted_cost

        return pv_total
```

**Geographic Adjustment System:**
```python
class GeographicAdjustmentService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.zip_to_msa = self.load_zip_msa_mapping()
        self.msa_cost_indices = self.load_msa_indices()

    def get_adjustment_factor(self, zip_code: str) -> float:
        msa = self.zip_to_msa.get(zip_code)
        if not msa:
            return 1.0  # Default if no data
        return self.msa_cost_indices.get(msa, 1.0)
```

        for validator in self.validators:
            result = validator.validate(research_data)
            validation_results.append(result)

        overall_confidence = self.calculate_confidence_score(validation_results)

        if overall_confidence < 0.85:
            return ValidationResult(
                status="REQUIRES_REVIEW",
                confidence=overall_confidence,
                issues=self.extract_issues(validation_results)
